      ## Why I want to join the WQAC
    </md-block>
    <md-block >
      I belive I would be a good fit for the team because, I meet the required qualifications and I am always happy to expand my knowledge/gain new skills. I enjoy writing and researching and so I think I would be a good fit for writing educational material.

      Some of the duties of the WQAC can be seen as data analysis, this is something I have experience with and I belive I am good at it.

      Another reason I think I am a good applicant is because I have more time then most adults as I will not be employed full time for a while and so I can commit more time. And so I can commit around 4 hours a week to WQAC work.
